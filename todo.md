## do now
add system path support

add remove from path command


add blink getting added to the project for packagin

add an export command 

add the ability to chain build.toml commands? cause you cant do that currently ( like i might have pip="eringe/ergtretg/ertg.pyz" and i want to run a pip command like pipInf="pip --version" but right now i would have to use pip again in the command instead of just saying pip, the only thing is then when you change stuff like lets say its pip3="eourngoeirng/retghrtgh/rthg.pyz" and i do pipVer="pip3 --version" then idk i have to rename shiz properly idk maybe an interactive command editor?)








## Med priority




## Low Priority
idk if this is important people can just add to their include path in visual studio
- add linux and mac support by including those binaries when using add if the they are added in the target platform in config.toml





## Dreams/ far future
make a command or toggle in config to when exporting it will copy all binaries off your system and into a blink folder but the issue there is stuff relys on more than the binary?? so do we go up a folder and take from there or what?? but that wont even work either cause some stuff is nested deep, oh well cool idea and could be very useful for even deeper path replication but idk.

turn it into a interactive shell so that you dont have to blink run but the thing is its hard plus theres so much i would have to change and such and tab completion and stuff idk
