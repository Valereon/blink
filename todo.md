## do now
- a add python and fetches the binaries from python.com and sets it up gracefully inside the proper folder and add the folders and add the binary to the path
- dont froget to add the package managers short hand t o build.toml like pip and npm

- make a verify method that goes through both TOMls and makes sure the paths are relative to the project root


## Med priority
- make blank toml to copy for projects that include all the settings
- improve ux in the command line and understanding of the tool
- command to list all path files and their paths



## Low Priority
idk if this is important people can just add to their include path in visual studio
- add linux and mac support by including those binaries when using add if the they are added in the target platform in config.toml
