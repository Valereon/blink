- make any string defined in build.toml executeable as a command
- some form of sandboxing?
- a add python and sets up the env script and the folders needed and fetches the binaries from my github
- get rid of the shell and subsitute for blink run {command} and it will use the env so i dont have to deal with a shell

- fix the incosnisty of relative and absoulte paths i think go for all absoulte adn combine the path fixing so that you can handle relative and normal paths in the same method
