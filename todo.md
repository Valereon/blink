## do now
- a add python and fetches the binaries from python.com and sets it up gracefully inside the proper folder and add the folders and add the binary to the path

- make a verify method that goes through both TOMls and makes sure the paths are relative to the project root
- finish the verify command and --fix command


- fix proccess spawning so my program DOES NOT handle in or out it just spawns the proper program with the right args and shit

## Med priority
- make blank toml to copy for projects that include all the settings
- improve ux in the command line and understanding of the tool
- command to list all path files and their paths
## Low Priority
- add support to chaNGE SLN files and others in vs and vscode for better inclusion and intellisense
idk if this is important people can just add to their include path in visual studio
- add linux and mac support by including those binaries when using add if the they are added in the target platform in config.toml
