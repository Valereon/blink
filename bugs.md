- the input redirect in the start process has some issues with reading that its causing you to have to press enter multiple times to start the program or end it : input.py in blink-example




- im sure someone smarter than me can fix it but in TOMLhandler in TOML array to list it complains about the string being possibly null, but i don't want to use string? and if i do a null check it still fucking complains so idk
